The website is built using modern technologies NextJS, TypeScript and TailwindCSS. NextJS is a React framework that provides functionalities such as server-side rendering and static-site generation. I decided to use NextJS as I have been working a lot with React recently and have heard the benefits NextJS provides. This project was the first time I properly used NextJS, TypeScript and TailwindCSS in a project and so was a massive learning opportunity for me. The development experience using these technologies was great and I will continue to use them for future projects. Making the change from JavaScript to TypeScript has been a challenge, however I believe the benefits TypeScript provides are worth the effort.


I didn't have to use a CMS for this project, but I really wanted to try out Strapi and implement it with Next. I also wanted to use some of Next's features such as getStaticProps and getStaticPaths which I was able to do using Strapi rather than just hard coding everything. I deployed the Strapi server to Heroku which was a bit of a challenge at first to get properly configured. Everything was working except the images which I discovered I had to host separately using a Cloudinary plugin with Strapi.


Overall, this was a great learning experience using all these technologies together and fixing all the bugs along the way.
